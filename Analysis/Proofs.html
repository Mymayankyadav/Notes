    <h3>4.8 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(f(p) \in V\) where \(V\) is open set in \(Y\), there would exist a neighbourhood of radius epsilon such that \(N_{\varepsilon}(f(p)) \subset V\)
        since \(f\) is continuous there would exist \(\delta\) such that whenever \(d_Y(f(p),f(x)) &lt; \varepsilon \) then \(d_X(x,p) &lt; \delta\)
        now these \(f(x) \in V\) hence all \(x\)'s\(\in f^{-1}(V)\) forming a \(\delta\) neighbourhood. Therefore \(f^{-1}(V)\) is open<br>
        Conversely,  if we create a open \(\varepsilon\)-neighbourhood around \(f(p)\)=\(V\) then we know that \(f^{-1}(V)\) is open in \(X\), there would be \(\delta\)-neighbourhood, subset of \(f^{-1}(V)\), hence is \(f(x)\in\) \(\varepsilon\)-neighbourhood
    </p>
    <h3>4.14 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        If we choose any open cover of \(f(X)\), take inverse image of every set in that open cover then it would be a cover of \(X\)
        hence there would be some finite open subcover, now if \(x \in X\) then it would belong to one of the open set of finite subcover, say \(x\in f^{-1}(V_{\alpha})\) then \(f(x) \in V_{\alpha}\)
        which proves that \(f(X)\) is compact.
    </p>
    <h3>4.19 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(\varepsilon &gt; 0\) for each point p in X we associate  \(\phi(p)\) such that
        \(q \in, d_X(p, q) &lt; \phi(p) \implies d_Y(f(p), f(q)) &lt; \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\)
        Let \(J(p)\) be the set of all \(q \in X\) such that
        $$d_X(p, q) &lt; \frac{1}{2}\phi(p)$$
        since \(J(p)\) is the set of open we get set of finite subcover such as
        $$X \subset J(p_1) \cup \cdot \cdot \cdot \cup J(p_n)$$
        We put
        $$\delta = \frac{1}{2}[\phi(p_1),....,\phi(p_n)]$$
        \(\delta &gt; 0\) since there are finite\(J(p)\)'s. Now \(p\) and \(q\) be points of \(X\), such that \(d_X(p, q) &lt; \delta \implies p \in J(p_m)\)
        $$d_X(p, p_m) &lt; \frac{1}{2}\phi(p_m)$$
        and we also have
        $$d_X(q, p_m) \leq d_X(p, q) + d_X(p, p_m) \leq \phi(p_m)$$
        Finally we have
        $$d_Y(f(p), f(q)) \leq d_Y(f(p), f(p_m)) + d_Y(f(q), f(q_m)) &lt; \varepsilon$$

    <h3>4.22 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Assume \(f(E) =A \cup B, A\) and \(B\) are separated, put \(G=E \cap f^{-1}(A), H=E \cap f^{-1}(B)\) Now \(G \subset f(\overline{A}) \implies \overline{G} \subset f^{-1}(\overline{A})\) since \(\overline{A}\) is closed. \(f(\overline{G}) \subset \overline{A}\) and \(f(H) =B\) we conclude \(\overline{G} \cap H\) is empty similarly we can show \(\overline{H} \cap G\) is empty. Thus contradicting the connectedness of \(E\).
    </p>
    <h3>5.9 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        let, $$h(t) =[f(b) - f(a)] g(t) - [g(b) - g(a)]f(t)$$ using theorem 4.16 \(h\) attains a maximum at some point \(x \implies h'(x) =0\). Rest follows
    </p>
    <h3>Taylor's theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let M be the number defined by $$f(\beta)= P(\beta) + M (\beta-\alpha)^n$$
        and put $$p(t)=f(t)-P(t)-M(t-\alpha)^n (a \leq t \leq b)$$
        $$\implies g^{(n)}(t)=f^{(n)}(t)-n!M$$ 
        Since \(P^{(k)}(\alpha)=f^{(k)}(\alpha)\) for all \(k &lt; n\) \(g^{(k)}(\alpha)=0\) by our choice of \(M\) shows that \(g(\beta)=0\), so that \(g’(x_1)=0\) for some \(x_1\) between \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), by mean value theorem. Since \(g’(\alpha)\) is zero we conclude that \(g’’(x_2)=0\) for some \(x_2\) in between \(\alpha\) and \(x_1\). Similarly \(g^{(n)}(x_n)=0\)
