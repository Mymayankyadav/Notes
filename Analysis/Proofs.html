    <h3>4.8 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(f(p) \in V\) where \(V\) is open set in \(Y\), there would exist a neighbourhood of radius epsilon such that \(N_{\varepsilon}(f(p)) \subset V\)
        since \(f\) is continuous there would exist \(\delta\) such that whenever \(d_Y(f(p),f(x)) &lt; \varepsilon \) then \(d_X(x,p) &lt; \delta\)
        now these \(f(x) \in V\) hence all \(x\)'s\(\in f^{-1}(V)\) forming a \(\delta\) neighbourhood. Therefore \(f^{-1}(V)\) is open<br>
        Conversely,  if we create a open \(\varepsilon\)-neighbourhood around \(f(p)\)=\(V\) then we know that \(f^{-1}(V)\) is open in \(X\), there would be \(\delta\)-neighbourhood, subset of \(f^{-1}(V)\), hence is \(f(x)\in\) \(\varepsilon\)-neighbourhood
    </p>
    <h3>4.14 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        If we choose any open cover of \(f(X)\), take inverse image of every set in that open cover then it would be a cover of \(X\)
        hence there would be some finite open subcover, now if \(x \in X\) then it would belong to one of the open set of finite subcover, say \(x\in f^{-1}(V_{\alpha})\) then \(f(x) \in V_{\alpha}\)
        which proves that \(f(X)\) is compact.
