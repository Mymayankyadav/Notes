    <h3>4.1.9 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If we assume that \((a)\subseteq (b) \neq R \) then for some \(c \in R, a=bc\), since \(a\) is irreducible, either \(b\) or \(c\) is a unit in \(R\). Since \((b) \neq R\), \(c\) must be a unit. then \(b=c^{-1}a \in (a)\). 
                Conversely, Assume \(a=bc\) and \(b\) is not a unit then \((a)\subset (c)\). This contradicts the maximality of \((a\) unless \(R =(c)\) which means \(c\) is a unit as required.
            </li>
            <li>
                If \(xy\in (a) \implies xy=ab\) this implies that \(a|xy\), since \(a\) is a prime either \(a|x\) or \(a|y\), say \(a|x\) i.e. \(x=ac\) for some \(c \in R \) hence \(x \in (a)\).
                Conversely, \((a)\) is a non zero prime ideal if \(a|xy\implies xy \in (a)\) hence either \(x \in (a)\) or \(y \in (a)\), say \(x \in (a)\) then \(a|x\)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>4.2.2 Proposition</h3>
    <p>
        \(d(R^*)\) is a non empty subset of \(\mathbb{Z}^+\) by well ordering principle there would be a least element \(1 \in d(R^*)\) such that \(l=d(e)\). Now, by division algorithm \(\exists q, r \in R\) s.t. \(a=qe+r\) with either \(r=0\) or else \(d(r) &lt; d(e)\). Later is not possible hence \(r=0\). Say \(e=q_{0}e\). Given \(x \in R^*\) we have \(xq_{0}e=xe\). Hence we get \(q_{0}=1\) is the unity of \(R\)
        \(d(1) \leq d(1e)= d(e)\) since \(d(e)\) is least \(\implies d(1)=d(e)\). Now \(d(x)\leq d(xx^{-1}) =d(1)\). If \(d(x) =d(1)\) then using division algorithm \(\exists q, r \in R\) s. t. \(1=qx+r\) with either \(r=0\) or else \(d(r) &gt; d(x) = d(1)\). hence \(r=0\).
    </p>
    <h3>4.3.1 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(I\) be any non zero Ideal then \(d(I^*)\) is non empty, therefore contains a least element \(a\) 
        we note that \(a \subset I\) if \(x\neq a\) and \(x\in I\) then by division algorithm 
        \(\exists q,r\) s.t. \(x=qa+r\) and \(d(r)&lt;d(a)\) since \(d(a)\) is the least element \(\implies r=0\) 

    </p>
    <h3>4.3.3 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \((a)\) be a irreducible element in \(R\) then by zorn's lemma \(\exists M \) such that \((a)\subset M \)
        but since \(R\) is PID \(\exists (p)=M\) using Theorem 4.1.9 \((p)=(a)\). 
    </p>
    <h3>4.3.5 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        \((d)\supseteq (a)+(b)\) since \(d|a \& d|b\). Now, \((a)+(b)=(c)\) since \(a\in (c)\implies c|a\) and similarly \(c|b\)
        which implies \(d\in (c)\) <br>
        Conversely, if \((d)= (a) + (b)\) if \(c\) is any common divisor of \(a \& b\) then \((d)\subset (c)\) which implies \(c|d\) 
    </p>
    <h3>4.4.2 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(\Omega\) be set of all the elements those can't be written as the products of unit and irreducible, using zorm's lemma we can find maximal ideal in the set of ideal generated by elements in \(\Omega\) 
        <br> let \(a \in \Omega\) be the an element such that \((a)\) is the maximal ideal \(a=bc\) then \((a)\subset (b)\) hence
        \(b,c \notin \Omega\) this implies that \(b\) and (c) can be written in terms of unit and irreducible element. Causing the required contradiction.
    </p>
    <h3>4.4.5 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(a\) be an irreducible element in a UFD \(R\). Let \(x, y \in R^*\) be such that \(a | xy\). \(\exists b\) such that  $$ab=xy=uvp_1p_2\cdot \cdot \cdot p_rq_1q_2 \cdot \cdot \cdot q_s$$
        since \(a\) is irreducible it must be an associate of one of the \(p_j \implies x=x'a \implies a|x \) as required
        <br>Conversely, Let \(x \ R^*\) have two factorisations into
        irreducibles (i.e., primes), say,$$x = up_1p_2 \cdot \cdot \cdot  p_r = vq_1 q_2 \cdot \cdot \cdot q_s$$. with \(u , v\)
        units and \(p_i , q_i\) primes. Now proceed by induction on \(r\) . If \(r = 0\),
        then \(x\) is a unit implying that any factor of x is a unit and hence \(s =
        0\). Assume that \(r \geq 1\) and the induction hypothesis. Note then that
        \(s \geq 1\) . Since \(p_1|x\) and \(p_1\) is a prime, we get that \(p_1 | q_i\) for some \(j\).
        Since \(q_i\) is also a prime, it follows that \(p_1\) and \(q_i\) are associates, and
        so there exists \(\alpha\) unit \(\alpha \in R\) such that \(q_j = \alpha p_1\) . Upon substituting
        for \(q_i\) in the factorisations of \(x\) and cancelling \(p_1\) , we get that
        $$x' = up_2 \cdot \cdot \cdot  p_r = v\alpha q_1 q_2 \cdot q_{i-l} q_{i+l} \cdot q_s$$ .
        The result follows by induction applied to \(x'\) in place of \(x\) .

    <h3>4.5.11 Gauss Lemma</h3>
    <p>
        If \(f(X)\) is primitive and irreducible in \(R[X]\). then \(f(X) =g(X)h(X)\) with \(g(X), h(X) \in K[X]\).We can write \(g(X) = (a/b)p(X)\) and \(h(X) =(c/d)q(X)\) with \(a, b, c, d \in R^*, p(X), q(X ) \in R[X]^*\) and both \(p(X)\) and \(q(X)\) primitive. Now substituting, we can write \(f(X) = (\alpha/\beta)p(X)q(X)\) for some \alpha , \(\beta \in R*\) with \(\alpha , \beta\) coprime. Thus we get \(\beta(X) = \alpha p(X )q(X)\) and hence comparing contents on either side, we have ,\(\beta c(f) = \alpha c(p)c(q)\) , i.e., \(\beta = \alpha\) which means \(f(X) = p(X)q(X)\) in \(R[X]\) contradicting the irreducibility of \(f(X)\).
