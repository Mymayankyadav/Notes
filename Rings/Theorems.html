    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <h3>2.2.5 Theorem</h3>
    <p>If \(R\) is a ring with 1 and \(I\) is a ideal in \(R\) such that \(I \neq R\), then there is a maximal ideal \(M\) of the same kind as \(I\) such that \(I \subseteq M\)
    <ol><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remarks:</span><li>The above theorem is not true if R has no unity.</li>
        <li>Above theorem need not be true for minimal ideals of R even if R is commutative with 1.</li></ol>
    </p>
    <h3>2 .2.9 Theorem</h3>
    <p> The set of all nilpotent elements in a commutative ring \(R\) with 1 is the intersection of all prime ideal, i. e., \(N = N'\).</p>
    <h3>2.4.1 Proposition</h3> 
    <p>Suppose \(R\) is a ring with 1. Let I be a left ideal. Then the following are equivalent.
    <ol><li>\(I\) = \(R\).</li><li>1 \(\in\) \(I\).</li><li>\(I\) contains a unit.</li><li>\(I\) contains an element which has a left inverse.</li></ol>
    </p>
    <h3>2.4.5 Proposition</h3>
    <p>Suppose \(R\) contains 1, and \(I\) is a 2-sided ideal of R. Then I = R \(\iff\) 1 \(\in\) \(I\) \(\iff\) I contains a unit \(\iff\) I contains an element which has a left inverse or a right inverse.
    </p>
    <h3>2.4.6 Theorem</h3>
    <p>Let \(R\) be a ring with 1 . Then \(R\) is a division ring \(\iff\) (0) and \(R\) are the only left ideals in \(R\) \(\iff\) (0) and \(R\) are the only right ideals in \(R\).</p>
    <h3>2.4.9 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
    Let \(R\) be a non-zero ring in which the multiplication is non-trivial. Then \(R\) is a division ring if and only if \(R\) has no left ideals other than (0) and \(R\), ( i. e., \(R\) contains a pair x , y such that xy\(\neq\)0. Then if \(R\) has no left (resp. right) ideals other than (0) and \(R\), \(R\) has 1 and \(R\) is a division ring) .

    <h3>2.4.10 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let R be a ring with 1 and \(S = M_n(I)\) , n \(\geq\) 1. Then we have the following.

        The converse is true only for 2-sided ideal, i. e., every two sided ideal \(K\) in \(S\) is of the form \(K = M_n(I)\)) for some 2-sided ideal \(J\) in \(R\).

If \(I\) is maximal, \(R/I\) is called the residue field of \(R\) at \(I\).</li><li>A maximal ideal ( in a commutative ring) is a prime ideal but not conversely.</li></ol>

        Suppoae \(R\) ia a commutative ring with 1 . Then \(a(X) = a_0 + a_1X + a_2X^2 + · · · + a_TX^T \in R[X]\) is a unit in \(R[X]\) if and only if \(a_0\) is a unit in R and \(a_1, a_2, · · · , a_T\) are all nilpotent in \(R\).
    </p>
    <h3>2.8.1 Proposition</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(R\) be a ring with 1 . Then the set \(M_R\) of all non-units in \(R\) is precisely the union of all proper left/right ideals of \(R\) which in turn is also equal to the union of all maximal left/right ideals of \(R\).
    </p>
    <h3>2.8.3 Proposition</h3>
    <p>
        A ring \(R\) with 1 is a local ring if and only if it has a unique maximal ideal, maxima/ simultaneously as a left/right/2-sided ideal.

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <h3>3.1.5 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(I\) be an ideal in a ring \(R\). Then \(I\) is a 2-sided ideal in \(R\) if and only if \(I\) is the kernel of some homomorphism \(f : R \to S\) for a suitable ring \(S\).
    </p>
    <h3>3.1.6 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        A homomorphism \(f : R \to S\) is a monomorphism if and only if Ker(\(f\)) = (0).
        <ol><b></b><li>Suppose \(f : R \to S\) and \(g : S \to T\) are homomorphisms of rings. Then \(Ker(g \circ f) \supseteq Ker(f)\) (equality need not hold) . If \(g \circ f\) is a monomorphsim, then \(f\) is a monomorphism.
        </li><li>Similarly, we have \(Im(g \circ f) \subseteq g(Im(f))\) (equality need not hold) . If \(g \circ f\) is an epimorphism, then \(g\) is an epimorphism.
        </li><li>Any homomorphism \(f : R \to S\) from a simple ring \(R\) (to any ring S) is either identically zero or a monomorphism (because Ker(\(f\)) is a 2-sided ideal in \(R\))
        </li></ol>
    </p>
    <h3>3.2.1 The Epimorphism Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(f : R \to S\)  be a homomorphism of rings with \(I = Ker(f)\). Then there exis ts a unique monomorphism \(T : R/I \to S\) such that the diagram commutes, i. e., \(f = \bar{f} \circ \eta\), where \(\eta\) is the natural map from \(R\) to \(R/I\).Moreover, \(T\) is an isomorphism if and only if \(f\) is an epimorphism.
    </p>
    <h3>3.2.2 Theorem: (Quotient of a quotient)</h3>
    <p>
         If \(I \subseteq J\) are both 2-sided ideals in \(R\), then \((R/I)/(J/I)\) is naturally isomorphic to \(R/J\).
    </p>
    <h3>3.2.3 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Suppose \(I\) and 1 are 2-sided ideals in a ring \(R\). Then the natural map \(\eta_{IJ} : R/I \to R/J\), defined by \(a + I \to a + J\) is well-defined if and only if \(I \subseteq J\) . Moreover, \(\eta_{IJ}\) is an epimorphism whose kernel is \(J/I\). Hence \((R/I)/(J/I)\) is ismomorphic to \(R/J\) .
    </p>
    <h3>3.2.5 Corollary</h3>
    <p>Let \(f : R \to S\) be a homomorphi8m of rings . Then we have the following.

    </p>
    <h3>3.2.6 Theorem</h3>
    <p>

    <h3>3.4.4 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        For any commutative integral domain \(R\) with 1 , \(\mathbb{Q}(R)\) is the smallest field containing \(R\) as a subring, having the same identity as \(R\), smallest in the sense that if \(K\) is a field containing \(R\) as a subring, then \(K \supseteq \mathbb{Q}(R)\) as a subfield. This \(\mathbb{Q}(R)\) is unique upto isomorphism, called the field of fractions of R.
