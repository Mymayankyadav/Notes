    <h3>Topology</h3>
    <p>A topology on a set \(X\) is a collection \(\tau\) of subsets of \(X\) having the following properties:
        <ol>
            <li>\(\phi\) and \(X\) are in \(\tau\).</li>
            <li>The union of the elements of any subcollection of \(\tau\) is in \(\tau\).</li>
            <li>The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of \(\tau\) is in \(\tau\).</li>
        </ol>
        A set \(X\) for which a topology \(\tau\) has been specified is called a topological space.
    </p>
    <h3>Open set</h3>
    <p>
        If \(X\) is a topological space with topology \(\tau\), we say that a subset \(U\) of \(X\) is an open set of \(X\) if \(U\) belongs to the collection \(\tau\).
    </p>
    <h3>Coarser</h3>
    <p>
        Suppose that \(\tau\) and \(\tau ‘\) are two topologies on a given set \( X\). If \(\tau’ \supset \tau \),we say that \(\tau’\) is <b>finer</b> than \(\tau\) ; if \(\tau’\) properly contains \(\tau\) , we say that \(\tau’\) is <b>strictly finer</b> than \(\tau\) . We also say that \(\tau\) is <b>coarser</b> than \(\tau’\) , or <b>strictly coarser</b>, in these two respective situations. We say \(\tau\) is <b>comparable</b> with \(\tau’\) if either \(\tau’ \supset tau\) or \(\tau \supset \tau’\) .  
    </p>
    <h3>Closed set</h3>
    <p>
        A subset \(A\) of a topological space \(X\) is said to be closed if the set \(X − A\) is open.
    </p>
    <h3>Closure and Interior of a Set</h3>
    <p>
        Given a subset \(A\) of a topological space \(X\), the <b>interior</b> of \(A\) is defined as the union of all open sets contained in \(A\), and the <b>closure</b> of \(A\) is defined as the intersection of all closed sets containing \(A\).
    </p>
    <h3>Nhood system</h3>
    <p>
            If \(X\) is a topological space and \(x \in X\), a <b>neighborhood</b>
    (hereafter abbreviated nhood) of \(x\) is a set \(U\) which contains an open set V
    containing \(x\). Thus, evidently, \(U\) is a nhood of \(x\) iff \(x\) in \(U^{\circ}\). The collection
    \(\mathbb{U}_x\), of all nhoods of \(x\) is the <b>nhood system</b> at \(x\).  
    </p>
    <h3>Nhood base</h3>
    <p>A nhood base at \(x\) in the topological space \(X\) is a subcollection ℬ\(_x\) taken from the nhood system \(x\) , having the property that each \(U \in x\) contains some \(V \in\) ℬ\(_x\). That is, x must be determined by ℬ\(_x\)
        as follows:<br>
        \(x = \{U \subset X | V \subset U\) for some \( V \in\) ℬ\(_x\}\)
    </p>
    <h3>Supspace</h3>
    <p>
        If \((X, \tau)\) is a topological space and \(A \subset X\), the collection \(\tau’ =\{G \cap A | G \in \tau\}\) is a topology for \(A\), called the relative topology for \(A\). The fact that a subset of \(X\) is being given this topology is signified by referring to it as a subspace of \(X\).  
    </p>
    <h3>Continuous function</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. A function \(f : X \to Y\) is said to be continuous if
        for each open subset \(V\) of \(Y\), the set \(f^{-1}(V)\) is an open subset of \(X\).  
    </p>
    <h3>Homeomorphism</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces; let \(f : X \to Y\) be a bijection. If both the function \(f\)
        and the inverse function
        $$f^{-1} : Y \to X$$
        are continuous, then \(f\) is called a homeomorphism.
        <br>Another way to define a homeomorphism to say that if \(f\) is bijective correspondence such that \(f(U)\) is open iff \(U\) is open.
    </p>
    <h3>Topological properties</h3>
    <p>
        Any properties that can be stated entirely on the basis of open set of \(X\) is called a topological properties
    </p>
    <h3>Cartesian Product</h3>
    <p>
        Let \( \{A_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in J}\) be an indexed family of sets; let \(X = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}A_{\alpha}\). The <b>cartesian product</b> of this indexed family, denoted by
        $$\prod_{\alpha \in J} A_{\alpha}$$
        is defined to be the set of all J-tuples \((x_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in J}\) of elements of \(X\) such that \(x_{\alpha}\in A_{\alpha}\) for each \(\alpha \in J\). That is, it is the set of all functions
        $$x:J \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} A_{\alpha}$$
        such that \(x(\alpha) \in A_{\alpha}\) for each \(\alpha \in J\).  
    </p>
    <h3>Projectionn mapping</h3>
    <p>
        Let $$\pi_{\beta}: \prod_{\alpha \in J}X_{\alpha} \to X_{\beta}$$ be the function assigning to
        each element of the product space its \(\beta\)th coordinate,$$\pi_{\beta}((x_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in J})=x_{\beta} $$
    </p>
    <h3>Product topology</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(S_{β}\) denote the collection $$ S_{\beta} =\{\pi_{\beta}^{-1}(U_{\beta})| U_{\beta}\ open\  in\ X_{\beta}\}$$
        and let \(S\) denote the union of these collections,$$S = \bigcup_{\beta \in J} S_{\beta}$$
        The topology generated by the subbasis \(S\) is called the product topology.
