    <h3>Theorem 17.1</h3>
    <p>
    Let \(X\) be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold:
    <ol>
        <li>\(\phi\) and \(X\) are closed.</li>
        <li>Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.</li>
        <li>Finite unions of closed sets are closed.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Theorem 17.2.</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(Y\) be a subspace of \(X\). Then a set \(A\) is closed in \(Y\) if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of \(X\) with \(Y\).  
    </p>
    <h3>Theorem 17.4.</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(Y\) be a subspace of \(X\); let \(A\) be a subset of \(Y\) ; let \(\overline{A}\) denote the closure of \(A\) in \(X\). Then the closure of \(A\) in \(Y\) equals \(\overline{A} \cap Y\) 
    </p>
    <h3>3.11 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        The interior operation \(A \to A^{\circ}\) in a topological
        space \(X\) has the following properties
        <ol>
            <li>\(A \subset A\).</li>
            <li>\((A^{\circ})^{\circ} =A^{\circ}\).</li>
            <li>\((A \cap B)^{\circ} =A^{\circ} \cap B^{\circ}\).</li>
            <li>\(X^{\circ} = X\).</li>
            <li>\(G\) is open iff \(G^{\circ} = G\).</li>
        </ol>
        Conversely, given any map \(A \to A^{\circ}\) of \(\mathbb{P}(X)\) into \(\mathbb{P}(X)\)  in a set \(X\), satisfying 1 through 4, if open sets are defined in \(X\) using 5,
        the result is a topology on \(X\) in which the interior of a set \(A \subset X\)
        is just \(A^{\circ}\).
    </p>
    <h3>4.5 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(X\) be a topological space and for each \(x \in X\),
        let ℬ\(_x\) be a nhood base at \(x\). Then
        <ol>
            <li>if \(V \in\) ℬ\(_x\), then \(x\) \in \(V\),</li>
            <li>if \(V_1, V_2 \in\) ℬ\(_x\), then there is some \(V_3 \in\) ℬ\(_x\) such that \(V_3 \subset V_1 \cap V_2\),</li>
            <li>if \(V \in\) ℬ\(_x\), there is some \(V_0 \in\) ℬ\(_x\) such that if \(y \in V_0\), then there is some \(W \in\) ℬ\(_y\) with \(W \subset V\), and furthermore,</li>
            <li>\(G \subset X\) is open iff \(G\) contains a basic nhood of each of its points.</li>
        </ol>
        Conversely, in a set \(X\), if a collection ℬ\(_x\) of subsets of \(X\) is assigned to each \(x \in X\) so as to satisfy 1,2 and 3 and if we define “open” using 4, the result is a topology on \(X\) in which ℬ\(_x\) is a nhood base at \(x\), for each \(x \in X\).
    </p>
    <h3>4.7 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(X\) be a topological space and suppose a nhood base has been fixed at each \(x \in X\). Then
        <ol>
            <li>\(G \subset X\) is open iff \(G\) contains a basic nhood of each of its points,</li>
            <li>\(F \subset X\) is closed iff each point \(x \notin F\) has a basic nhood disjoint from \(F\),</li>
            <li>\(\overline{E}\) = {\(x \in X\) | each basic nhood of \(x\) meets \(E\)},</li>
            <li>\(E^{\circ}\) = {\(x \in X\) | some basic nhood of \(x\) is contained in \(E\)},</li>
            <li>Fr (\(E\)) = {\(x \in X\) | each basic nhood of \(x\) meets both \(E\) and \(X- E\)}.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>4.8 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        (Hausdorff criterion) For each \(x \in X\), let ℬ\(_x^1\) be a nhood base at \(x\) for a topology \(\tau_1\) on \(X\), and let ℬ\(_x^2\) be a nhood base at \(x\) for a topology \(\tau_2\) on \(X\). Then \(\tau_1 ⊂ \tau_2\) iff at each \(x \in X\), given \(B^1 \in\) ℬ\(_x^1\) , there is some \(B^2 \in\) ℬ\(_x^2\) such that \(B^2 ⊂ B^1\)
    </p>
    <h3>6.3 Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        If \(A\) is a subspace of a topological space \(X\), then:
        <ol>
            <li>\(H\) \(\subset\) \(A\) is open in \(A\) iff \(H\) = \(G\) \(\cup\) \(A\), where \(G\) is open in \(X\),</li>
            <li>\(F\) \(\subset\) \(A\) is closed in \(A\) iff \(F = K\) \(\cup\) \(A\) where \(K\) is closed in \(X\),</li>
            <li>if \(E\) \(\subset\) \(A\), then \(Cl_A E\) = \(A\) \(\cup\) \(Cl_X E\),</li>
            <li>if \(x\) \(\in\) \(A\), then V is a nhood of x in \(A\) iff V = U \(\cup\) \(A\), where U is a nhood of \(x\) in \(X\),</li>
            <li>if \(x\) \(\in\) \(A\), and if ℬ\(_x\) is a nhood base at \(x\) in \(X\), then {\(B\) \(\cup\) \(A\) | \(B\) \(\in\) ℬ\(_x\)} is a nhood base at \(x\) in \(A\),</li>
            <li>if ℬ is a base for \(X\), then {\(B\) \(\cup\) \(A\) | \(B\) \(\in\) ℬ} is a base for \(A\).</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Theorem 18.1</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces; let \(f : X \to Y\). Then the
        following are equivalent:
        <ol>
            <li>\(f\) is continuous.</li>
            <li>For every subset \(A\) of \(X\), one has \(f (\overline{A}) \subset \overline{f (A)}\).</li>
            <li>For every closed set \(B\) of \(Y\), the set \(f^{-1}(B)\) is closed in \(X\).</li>
            <li>For each \(x \in X\) and each neighborhood \(V\) of f (x), there is a neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) such that \(f (U) \subset V\) .</li>
        </ol>
        If the condition in 4 holds for the point \(x\) of \(X\), we say that <b>\( f\) is continuous at
        the point \(x\)</b>.  
    </p>
    <h3>Theorem 18.2 (Rules for constructing continuous functions)</h3>
    <p>
        Let \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) be topological spaces.
        <ol>
            <li>(Constant function) If \(f : X \to Y\) maps all of \(X\) into the single point \(y_0\) of \(Y\), then f is continuous.</li>
            <li>(Inclusion) If \(A\) is a subspace of \(X\), the inclusion function \(j : A \to X\) is continuous.</li>
            <li>(Composites) If \(f : X \to Y\) and \(g : Y \to Z\) are continuous, then the map \(g \circ f : X \to Z\) is continuous.</li>
            <li>(Restricting the domain) If \(f : X \to Y\) is continuous, and if \(A\) is a subspace of \(X\), then the restricted function \(f |A : A \to Y\) is continuous.</li>
            <li>(Restricting or expanding the range) Let \(f : X \to Y\) be continuous. If \(Z\) is a subspace of \(Y\) containing the image set \(f (X)\), then the function \(g : X \to Z\) obtained by restricting the range of \(f\) is continuous. If \(Z\) is a space having \(Y\) as a subspace, then the function \(h : X \to Z\) obtained by expanding the range of \(f\) is continuous.</li>
            <li>(Local formulation of continuity) The map \(f : X \to Y\) is continuous if \(X\) can be written as the union of open sets \(U_{\alpha}\) such that \(f |U_{\alpha}\) is continuous for each \(\alpha\).</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Theorem 18.3 (The pasting lemma). </h3>
    <p>
        Let \(X = A \cup B\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are closed
        in \(X\). Let \(f : A \to Y\) and \(g : B \to Y\) be continuous. If \(f (x) = g(x)\) for every
        \(x \in A \cap B\), then \(f\) and \(g\) combine to give a continuous function \(h : X \to Y\), defined
        by setting \(h(x) = f (x)\) if \(x \in A\), and \(h(x) = g(x)\) if \(x \in B\).
